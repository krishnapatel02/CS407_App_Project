# CS407_App_Project
An android weather app that makes a call to an API and displays the data. Current app simply fetches data and displays it. There is no major UI.
There is also an issue with the units button not working which will be fixed in the next iteration.
User location permission must be given to the app prior to running, and the device location must be enabled.
